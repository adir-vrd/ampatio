AMPatio
=======
simple easy to use python alternative for access AMLogic based socs low level perpherals
for How-To access the GPIO take a look at the examples folder


! NOTE !
========
Most of the hardware that will be present soon in the examples folder will used to pass data by BitBang method only for now.

To use SPI, ADC, PWM... we need to set most of meson modules in the kernel as dynamicly loaded.
To do so, it's require from us to recompile the Linux kernel, but until i would do so i wrote only the GPIO part.

The next list is the builtin kernel modules need to be markd as dynamic include: (also look at /sys/devices/platform/soc)
- ADC
- UART
- SPI
- IIC
- PWM
- IR (Blaster & Decoder)


2Do:
====
-- Package setup with path

Basic:
`-gpio.py
  =======
  -- add occupied and release pin functions (record json file in /tmp folder directly in memory)
  -- add buffer read & write of bytes / arrays
  ##
  -+ do more efficent error handaling
  ##
  -- create relevant dungen functions & improved by decoration

Analog:
`-adc.py

Serial:
|-uart.py
|-iic.py (i2c)
`-spi.py

Pulse:
|-pwm.py
|-irb.py (InfraRed Blaster)
`-ird.py (InfraRed Decoder)
